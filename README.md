# Enhancing-Magazine-Content-Strategy-with-LDA-Topic-Modeling

In this project, we aimed to assist a magazine editor in identifying the themes and subtopics present in previously published articles. By leveraging Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic modeling, we analyzed a comprehensive dataset of Policy and Ethics articles to reveal underlying topics and suggest areas for new content.

### Methods:
- **Dataset**: Policy and Ethics articles from a magazine, chosen for its extensive coverage.
- **Technique**: Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) for topic modeling, implemented using the Gensim library.
- **Libraries**: 
  - **Gensim**: For building and training the LDA model.
  - **pyLDAvis**: For visualizing the topics generated by the LDA model.

### Results:
The LDA model successfully identified various topics within the dataset, providing insights into the content's thematic distribution. The visualizations generated by pyLDAvis helped the editor understand the key topics and potential gaps in the content, guiding future content creation strategies.
